\chapter{Polynomial Approximations - Interpolation}
% Brady is currently working on this section

The reason people have such interest in polynomials---and in polygons and polyhedra---is because of the following approximation theorem:

\begin{theorem}[Weierstrass Approximation Theorem]
If $f$ is any continuous function on the finite closed interval $[a,b]$, then for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists a polynomial $p(x)$ (whose degree and coefficients depend on $\epsilon$) such that 
$$
\max_{x\in [a,b]} \mid f(x) - p(x) \mid \; < \, \epsilon
$$
\end{theorem}

Of course, this theorem doesn't tell us how to construct $p(x)$, or even what the degree of $p(x)$ is. 

We will look at the construction of interpolating polynomials, at error estimates, and some difficulties.
In practice, one patches together series of low-order polynomial approximations, such as in splines and Bezier patches.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Modeling scenes with sparse data.
    \item CAD representations.
    \item Data compression. (e.g., tables)
    \item Generating robot trajectories that pass through given set points (inverse kinematics). 
\end{itemize}


\section{Polynomial Forms}

\textbf{Power form:}
$$
p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \dots + a_n x^n
$$

where $a_n \neq 0$ and the polynomial is degree $n$. Numerical round-off can lead to a loss of significance for $x$ no near zero. 

\textbf{Shifted power form:}
$$
p(x) = a_0 + a_1 (x-c) + a_2 (x-c)^2 + \dots + a_n(x-c)^n
$$

Taylor expansion for $p(x)$ about $c$ and $a_i = \frac{p^{(i)}(c)}{i!}$

\textbf{Newton form:}
\begin{align*}
p(x) = a_0 &+ a_1 (x-c_1) \\
           &+ a_2 (x-c_1)(x-c_2) \\
           &\,+ \\
           &\,\, \vdots \\
           &\,+ \\
           &a_n (x-c_1)(x-c_2)\dots(x-c_n)
\end{align*}
$n+\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ adds; $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ multiplies.

\textbf{Nested Newton form:}
\begin{equation*}
    p(x) = a_0 + (x-c_1)\left\{a_1 + (x-c_2)\left[a_2 + \dots + (x-c_{n-1})(a_{n-1}+(x-c_n)a_n)\right]\right\}
\end{equation*}
$2n$ adds; $n$ multiplies. 

It is easy to write a recursive algorithm to evaluate $p(x)$ in nested Newton form. To evaluate $p(x)$ given $x$, $a_0, \dots, a_n$, $c_1, \dots, c_n$: 

\quad \textsf{poly\_eval}($x$; $a_0, \dots, a_n$; $c_1, \dots, c_n$)

\qquad \qquad $a_0 + (x-c_1)\;\cdot\; $\textsf{poly\_eval}($x$; $a_1, \dots, a_n$; $c_2, \dots, c_n$)

\section{Polynomial Interpolation}

Suppose $f: [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ 

And suppose $x_0, x_1, \dots , x_n$ are $n+1$ distinct points in $[a,b]$. 

We want to construct a polynomial of degree $n$ or less that interpolates $f(x)$ at the points $\{x_i\}$. 
That is, we want a polynomial $p(x)$ such at

\begin{equation*}
    p(x_i) = f(x_i) \qquad i = 1, \dots, n.
\end{equation*}

There exists a unique such polynomial. We will see it shortly. 

To see uniqueness, suppose $p$ and $q$ are each polynomials of degree at most $n$ that agree at the $\{x_i\}$. 
Then $p-q$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n$ that vanishes at the $\{x_i\}$. 
Therefore, by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

\begin{equation*}
    (p-q)(x) = c \prod_{i=0}^n (x-x_i)
\end{equation*}
where $c$ is some real number. The left hand side has degree at most $n$. The right hand side has degree exactly $n+1$, unless $c=0$. So, $c=0$, and then $p=q$, meaning that $p$ is unique. 

Uniqueness tells us that the different ways of writing the interpolating polynomial $p(x)$ are really the same, and must therefore differ primarily on numerical grounds (e.g. compactness, stability, ...).

\subsection{Lagrange Form}

The \underline{Lagrange Form} is a straightforward way of constructing the interpolating polynomial:

\begin{equation*}
    p(x) = a_0 l_0 (x) + a_1 l_1 (x) + \dots + a_n l_n (x)
\end{equation*}

where each $l_i(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ that satisfies
\begin{equation*}
    l_i(x_k) = \begin{cases}
      1 \quad \mathrm{if} \quad i=k\\
      0 \quad \mathrm{if} \quad i \neq k
    \end{cases}  
\end{equation*}
$i=0,\dots,n$ and $a_i=f(x_i)$. 

In other words,
\begin{equation*}
    l_i(x) = \prod_{\substack{k=0 \\ k\neq i}}^n \frac{x-x_k}{x_i-x_k}
\end{equation*} 

\underline{Example:} Suppose we start with a polynomial, say 
\begin{equation*}
    f(x) = (x-1)^2
\end{equation*}
And suppose we have two values, at $x_0=0$ and $x_1 = 1$:

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        f(0)=1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a_0 = 1 \\
        f(1)=0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a_1 = 0
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Now $p(x) = a_0 l_0 (x) + a_1 l_1 (x)$ 

Since $a_1 = 0$, we only care about $l_0(x)$.

\begin{equation*}
    l_0 (x) = \frac{x-x_1}{x_0-x_1} = \frac{x-1}{0-1} = -x + 1
\end{equation*}
so $p(x) = -x + 1$, which is a line. 

This polynomial interpolates $f(x)$, but not very well, as one would imagine.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \input{figures/chap_03/03-polynomial.tikz}
    % \caption{Caption}
    \label{fig:polynomial-1}
\end{figure}
So, let's add the value of $f$ at a third point, say $x=-1$. 

$f(-1)=4$, so 

\begin{align*}
        x_0=0& \qquad a_0 = 1 \\
        x_1=1& \qquad  a_1 = 0 \\
        x_2=-1& \qquad  a_2 = 4 \\
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
    l_0(x) &= \quad \frac{x-x_1}{x_0-x_1} \cdot \frac{x-x_2}{x_0-x_2} \quad=\quad -(x-1)(x+1) \\
    l_1(x) &= \quad \frac{x-x_0}{x_1-x_0} \cdot \frac{x-x_2}{x_1-x_2} \quad=\quad \text{we don't care} \\
    l_2(x) &= \quad \frac{x-x_0}{x_2-x_0} \cdot \frac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1} \quad=\quad \frac{1}{2}x(x-1)
\end{align*}
Now, \begin{align*}
    p(x) &= a_0 l_0(x) + a_1 l_1(x) + a_2 l_2(x) \\
         &= -(x-1)(x+1) + 2x(x-1) \\
         &= \;\;\;(x-1) \left[2x-(x+1)\right] \\
         &= \;\;\;(x-1)(x-1) \\
         &= \;\;\;(x-1)^2
\end{align*}
So, as one would hope, this approximation is exact. \\

\noindent \underline{Comments}
\begin{itemize}
 \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\qedsymbol$} 
 \item  The goodness of an approximation depends on the number of approximating points and also their location. 
 
        We will look at error estimates.
 \item One problem with the Lagrange form of the interpolating polynomial is that we need 
        \begin{align*}
                  &2(n+1) \quad \text{mul/div} \\
            \& \; &2n+1 \quad \quad \text{add/sub}
        \end{align*}
        to evaluate $p(x)$ at a given point $x$, \underline{even after} all the denominators have been calculated once and for all and divided into the $a_i$ values. 
        
        If we could write the interpolating polynomial in nested form we could get away with half that many multiplication operations. ---We won't worry about this. 
 \item Another problem is that in practice, one may be uncertain as to how many interpolation points to use. 
       So, one may want to increase them over time and see whether the approximation gets better. 
       In doing so, one would like to use the old approximation. 
       It isn't clear how to do that easily with the Lagrange form. 
       
       We will look at this. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Divided Differences}

This is basically a way of writing the interpolating polynomial in Newton form. 

Let $p_n(x)$ denote the interpolating polynomial of degree $n$ (or less), that interpolates $f(x)$ at $x_0, \dots, x_n$. 

Suppose we write $p_n(x)$ as

\begin{equation*}
    p_n(x) = A_0 + A_1(x-x_0) + A_2(x-x_0)(x-x_1)+ \dots + A_n(x-x_0)\dots(x-x_{n-1})
\end{equation*}

\vspace{-.4cm} 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \hspace{3.2cm}
    \input{figures/chap_03/arrow.tikz}
    \label{fig:polynomial-2}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-.7cm} 
\noindent Now notice that this last term vanishes at $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$. Therefore, the previous $n$ terms must comprise the interpolating polynomial of degree $n-1$ (or less) that agrees with $f(x)$ at $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$. In other words,

\begin{equation*}
    p_{n-1}(x) = A_0 + A_1(x-x_0) + \dots + A_{n-1}(x-x_0)\dots(x-x_{n-2})
\end{equation*}

with same $\left\{A_i\right\}$ coefficients as for $p_n(x)$. 

In short,

\begin{equation*}
    p_n(x) = p_{n-1}(x) + A_n(x-x_0)\dots(x-x_{n-1})
\end{equation*}

So, we can build $p_n(x)$ from $p_{n-1}(x)$. \\
 
\underline{Now, what are the $\left\{A_i\right\}$?} 

Suppose we define $f\left[x_i,x_{i+1},\dots,x_m\right]$ to be the leading coefficient of the polynomial of degree $m-i$ (or less) that agrees with $f(x)$ at the distinct points $x_i, \dots, x_m$.
