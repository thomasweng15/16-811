\chapter{Calculus of Variations}
Worked on by Ratnesh

The calculus of variations arose in tight complicity with the development of mechanics. 
Much of the axiomatic grounding of physics in general and mechanics in particular consists of variational principles. 
Indeed, the rudiments of quantum theory may be derived from Newton's laws and variational principles. 
We will in these notes trace some of the history of the calculus of variations. 
One caution: while much of the treatment will seem mathematical, it is in fact very handwavy. 
A true and correct treatment would require us to pull out such differential geometry tools as covariant derivatives, affine connections, and n-forms.
