Differential geometry studies the motions possible in a space. Some
key concepts:

\textbf{Tangent vector $v_p$}: A vector anchored at a particular
point $p$. Set of all possible $v_p$ for a given $p$ is called the tangent
space $T_p$ at $p$.

\textbf{Tangent Bundle}: A space along with all its tangent vectors.
