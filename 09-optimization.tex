\chapter{Optimization}

Worked on by Alex.

This is another vast and deep subject, and we will only take a brief peak.
We have of course already seen some forms of optimization, in the form of error minimization.
No doubt you are familiar as well with the optimization of linear systems.
In this set of notes we will focus on optimizing arbitrary non-linear functions.
And in the next section of notes we will consider optimization of functionals, that is, functions of functions.

\section{Applications (Let's focus on robotics-related optimization)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Minimize energy/power consumption.
  \item Minimize torque, null space forces.
  \item Path planning via potential fields.
  \item Computation of stable resting configurations.
  \item Maximize sensing information. (e.g. where to probe next?)
  \item Optimize execution time (Actually, this leads to Markov Decision Theory, Dynamic Programming, and Calculus of Variations. We will discuss C of V in detail later.)
\end{itemize}

We will now become increasingly more analytical and less numerical.
You should also put on your geometric thinking caps, since much of the analysis is best understood in terms of geometry.
