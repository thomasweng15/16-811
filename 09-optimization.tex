\chapter{Optimization}

Worked on by Alex.

This is another vast and deep subject, and we will only take a brief peak. We have of course already seen some forms of optimization, in the form of error minimization. No doubt you are familiar as well with the optimization of linear systems. In this set of notes we will focus on optimizing arbitrary non-linear functions. And in the next section of notes we will consider optimization of functionals, that is, functions of functions.

\section{Applications (Let's focus on robotics-related optimization)}
